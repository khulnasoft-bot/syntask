        Bug reports are often **usage questions, not bugs**. If you do not have a strong understanding 
        of the interface you are reporting a bug for, please head to our [Community Slack](https://www.syntask.io/slack/)
        or [Discourse](https://discourse.syntask.io/) and ask there first. You are likely to get a response
        faster and learn more about the feature you're working with. If the issue is determined to be a bug,
        we will open an issue here.

        GitHub issues raised against this repository will receive community support. If you have an
        [active support agreement](https://www.syntask.io/pricing/), we recommend creating a case to ensure
        a faster response.

        If you are new to Syntask bug reports, please review our many examples of [well written bug reports](https://github.com/Synopkg/syntask/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22great+writeup%22). 
        Each of these reports include the following features:

        1. A **succinct description of the problem** - typically a line or two at most

        2. A **succinct code example which reproduces the problem**, otherwise known as a [minimal, complete, and verifiable](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) example.

        3. The **complete stack traces for errors - please avoid screenshots, and use formatted text inside issues**

        4. Additional details that may help us reproduce your issue.

        Provide information about your Syntask version and environment. The easiest way to retrieve all of the information we require is the `syntask version` command.
        If using Syntask 1.x, it is useful to also include the output of `syntask diagnostics`.
        **Please do not just include your Syntask version number**. The command provides additional context such as your operating system, Syntask API type, Python version, etc. that we need to diagnose your problem.
